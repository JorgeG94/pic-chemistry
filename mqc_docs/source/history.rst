Origin of Metalquicha
=====================

Metalquicha originated as a "I need to write this code for an invited talk at Pacifichem" throughout
the year 2025. Metalquicha depends on a personal hobby project of mine, called `pic <https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic>`_ history,
which is a Fortran library that resembles a standard library, like the STL from C/C++.

The pic library provides data structures, algorithms, and utilities that make development
in Metalquicha easier and faster. Alongisde with pic, Metalquicha also uses pic to provide
access to MPI and BLAS functionalities through `pic mpi <https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-mpi>`_
and `pic blas <https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-blas>`_.

The main idea behind Metalquicha (and its associated presentation at Pacifichem) was to show
that Fortran can be used as a modern programming language, with the ability to do rapid prototyping,
and the development of complex quanutm chemistry software. Most of the development was spent
writing the pic libraries, Metalquicha was mostly a side projecto to showcase the capabilities
applied to quanutm chemistry.

However, after the presentation at Pacifichem, I had some personal leave and time to polish the code
and add more features. I think it might be a useful program for the community, so I decided
to make things nice and add some documentation for maybe some users to try it out.

This is a purely hobby project, so as long as I am not on leave (most of the time) I only work
on this on my off time and weekends, so please be patient with bug fixes and new features.
