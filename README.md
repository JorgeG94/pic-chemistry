# Met'al q'uicha (metalquicha)

Met'al q'uicha, which I'll just write as metalquicha is a sample quantum chemistry backend 
with focus on using the [pic](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic) library and its derivatives:
[pic-mpi](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-mpi) and [pic-blas](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-blas)
which are Fortran based implementations of commonly used routines such as sorting algorithms, 
array handling, strings, loggers, timers, etc. While pic-mpi and pic-blas provide modern 
Fortran interfaces to MPI and BLAS implementations in a portable way. Specifically, the MPI
library lets the user switch betwen the `mpi` and `mpi_f08` modules with ease. 

Metalquicha implements a naive backend for unfragmented and fragmented quantum chemistry
calculations. Currently, metalquicha uses [tblite](https://github.com/tblite/tblite) as 
its chemistry engine which performs energy calculations. 

The main purpose of this package is to showcase the ability of being able to write 
simple, powerful Fortran based programs that are able to access massively parallel 
ecosystems with ease. 

## Building 

You will need an internet connection to download the dependencies. The main dependencies are:

- CMake 
- A Fortran compiler 
- An MPI installation 
- A BLAS/LAPACK install 

You can then simply:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j 
```

### Building with the Fortran Package Manager (FPM)

FPM hardcodes some dependencies, specially the linking to `openblas`. So you will need openblas to build with 
FPM. 

Simply then just do: `fpm install --prefix . --compiler mpifort --profile release`

#### Obtaining the FPM

Install the FPM following the [instructions](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html#install) and then simply: `fpm install`
