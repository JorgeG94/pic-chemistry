# Summary

Metalquicha is a Fortran library for massively parallel, fragmented quantum
chemistry calculations with emphasis in modularity, reusability, and ease
of adoption. It supports the Generalized Many Body Expansion (GMBE) with
and without overlapping fragments and can compute scalar and matrix-like
GMBE quantities, such as energies, gradients, and hessians using xtb
as a backend.


# Statement of need

Quantum chemistry methods are known for being computationally expensive and
impractical for realistic chemical systems, such as proteins, enzymes, and
materials [@gordon_fragmentation_2012]. Fragmentation methods offer a way to address the scalability problem
and additionally expose a naively parallel problem, i.e. all fragments
can be computed independently of each other.

The Fortran programming language has been extensively used in the quanutm
chemistry community, a number of legacy packages and new ones exist in the
literature [@zahariev_general_2023; @apra_nwchem_2020; @manathunga_quantum_2023; @bannwarth_extended_2021; @mironov_openqp_2024]. However, there is no modern Fortran package that leverages the
use of fragmenation techniques to access massively parallel architectures.

Additionally, fragmentation has been historically underexplored due to the
software complexity of implementing fragmentation routines in existing
packages. This is mostly because fragmentation needs to be implemented
at the very top level of a software package in order to fully leverage
the parallelism offered by it. Currently, only four packages in the literature
support fragmentation natively[@zahariev_general_2023; @galvez_vallejo_toward_2023; @takami_open-architecture_2007; @broderick_span_2025] - the rest, offer fragmentatin capabilities
through file based interfaces, which can be difficult to scale beyond a
couple processes.

Metalquicha, offers a Fortran based fragmentation framework that is able
to bind to external quanutm chemistry engines, provided a C like interface
is available to compute the core physical properties required. This aims to
simplify the adoption of fragmentation routines by allowing existing quantum
chemistry programs to write interfaces such as `calculate_quantity` where
quantity can be energy, gradient, hessian, etc. This allows existing
programs to access high level parallelism and work-load distribution
frameworks.

Metalquicha addresses the following community needs:

- Fortran based programs have been scared into adopting C++ for modernisation, Metalquicha aims to showcase that Fortran can still be used for massively parallel  quanutm chemistry applications
- A permissive licensed, reusable software that can be extended freely
- A modern modular fragmentation framework that can accommodate any type of quanutm chemistry method

Additionally, Metalquicha uses modern Fortran language features such as native
documentation through the Ford project and the use of the [Fortran package manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) (FPM)
in addition to CMake to be compiled and consumed.

# Software Description

## Scope

Metalquicha contains two high level routines: MBE and GMBE[@richard_generalized_2012] serial and MPI enabled
fragment workload distribution schemes that support non-covalently bound, and
covalently bound fragments using either overlapping fragments or hydrogen caps.

At the core of the fragment distribution scheme is the `node_worker` subroutine which
assigns a specific task to a process. In most cases, this is the calculation of
a property, such as the energy, gradient, or hessian matrix of a molecule. A
figure of the overall MPI distribution scheme is show here:

Currently, the `xtb` method is the only supported quantum chemistry "oracle". The
quantum chemistry engines are enabled via an abstract `calculation_method` object
that can be extended to support multiple types of methodologies. This allows
Metalquicha to be easily extended to replace `xtb` with a Restricted Hartree-Fock
(RHF) method, Density Functional Theory (DFT), among others.

## Current capabilities

Provided enough work, Metalquicha will scale up to an arbitrary number of processors, since the (G)MBE is naively parallel.

The main bottleneck of the simulation should be obtaining the property of the chemical
system however, for cheap methods such as `xtb`, the final computation of the fragmented
energy can become a bottleneck if enough fragments are created.

## Documentation

The code is thoroughly documented using FORD for program extendability and the use of
Metalquicha is covered in a read-the-docs hosted website.

## Testing

Automated unit tests and regression tests are run through Github Actions on every push,
ensuring the code is correct at every code modification.

## Input file format

In order to ensure portability, Metalquicha reads simple text files to process the chemical
input for a calculation. However, the front end uses a json format based on the QCSchema
and a python program to translate the json to the `mqc` format for Fortran consumption.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the Fortran lang community for the development of projects
used in Metalquicha, such as the FPM, LFortran, and the inspiration found in the stdlib project.

I also would like to thank Ivan Pribec for listening to my programming debacles.

Finally, I'd like to thank my wife Dr. Elizabeth Gehrmann for enduring me developing this
code in my free time.
